## 2024-06-11: Migrated to profiles-based authentication flow

- Updated Supabase migration (0000_profiles.sql) to use a single `profiles` table for user data and roles, with triggers and RLS policies.
- Updated `AuthContext` and `middleware` to use `profiles` for role and profile management.
- Manually updated `AuthForm.tsx` and `SignUpForm.tsx` to:
  - Use Supabase's built-in signUp/signInWithPassword/verifyOtp flows
  - No longer reference or insert into `user_roles` (now handled by trigger)
  - Fetch and use profile data after login/signup as needed
- Verified that signup, login, and OTP verification flows work with the new schema.
- Next: Refactor any remaining components to use `profiles` for role checks and user data.

## Component Renaming - 2024-04-10
- Renamed `AuthForm.tsx` to `SignInForm.tsx` for better clarity

### Technical Details
- Created migration `0011_add_previous_values_to_audit.sql`
- Modified `update_user_profile_v2` to store both previous and new values
- Added `previous_values` field to audit log details
- Maintains existing audit structure while adding more context
- Example audit log entry now includes:
  ```json
  {
    "target_user_id": "...",
    "target_user_role": "user",
    "updated_fields": {
      "first_name": "New Name",
      "gender": "male"
    },
